# Simple Taylor Decomposition

it is used to calculate the relevance of each pixel, give a explanation of neural network

### note
* relu is  used as the activation function
* the output of the model is logistic (without passing to the softmax)
* traing the model without biases
* the relevance score is calculated by X * (the Partial derivatives of X with respect to logistic)
